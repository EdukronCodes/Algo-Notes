This means that as median income increases, housing prices tend to increase as well.\n","\n","2. **HouseAge (Median House Age) and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: 0.105623\n","   - Interpretation: There is a weak positive correlation (0.105623) between Median House Age and Housing Price. The correlation suggests that there is a slight tendency for newer houses to have higher prices, but the relationship is not very strong.\n","\n","3. **AveRooms (Average Number of Rooms) and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: 0.151948\n","   - Interpretation: There is a relatively weak positive correlation (0.151948) between the Average Number of Rooms and Housing Price. Houses with more rooms tend to have slightly higher prices, but the relationship is not very strong.\n","\n","4. **AveBedrms (Average Number of Bedrooms) and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.046701\n","   - Interpretation: There is a weak negative correlation (-0.046701) between the Average Number of Bedrooms and Housing Price. This suggests that, on average, houses with more bedrooms may have slightly lower prices, but the relationship is not strong.\n","\n","5. **Population and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.024650\n","   - Interpretation: There is a very weak negative correlation (-0.024650) between Population and Housing Price. This suggests that areas with higher population may have slightly lower housing prices, but the correlation is very weak.\n","\n","6. **AveOccup (Average Occupancy) and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.023737\n","   - Interpretation: There is a very weak negative correlation (-0.023737) between Average Occupancy and Housing Price. This indicates that areas with higher average occupancy may have slightly lower housing prices, but the correlation is very weak.\n","\n","7. **Latitude and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.144160\n","   - Interpretation: There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.144160) between Latitude and Housing Price. As you move north (higher latitude), housing prices tend to be lower.\n","\n","8. **Longitude and Price:**\n","   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.045967\n","   - Interpretation: There is a weak negative correlation (-0.045967) between Longitude and Housing Price. This suggests that as you move east (higher longitude), housing prices tend to be slightly lower.\n","\n","In summary, Median Income (MedInc) has the strongest positive correlation with Housing Price, while Latitude has the strongest negative correlation. Other factors such as House Age, Number of Rooms, Number of Bedrooms, Population, and Average Occupancy have relatively weaker correlations with Housing Price.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"X919G673kURk"},"id":"X919G673kURk"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Constructing the heatmap\n","####Light colors represent negative correlation and dark color
